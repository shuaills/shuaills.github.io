Hey, I'm Shuai. This little corner of the internet is where I jot down what I'm building, reading, and thinking about. Topics change with whatever I'm curious about that weekâ€”sometimes it's a coding project, other times it's a paper or a new tool I'm trying out.

If you want to say hi or swap notes, reach me at shishuaicareer@gmail.com or find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/shuaills).
